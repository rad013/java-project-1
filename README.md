This project is a console card game that simulates a simplified version of blackjack, where the goal is to get a card score as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game involves betting points, which are earned by winning or lost by losing. The game has six pages: home, login, register, menu, play, and highscore.

In the home page, the user can choose between login or register. In the login and register page, the user can create an account with a username and password, or log in with an existing account. The user data is stored in an encrypted file using AES algorithms. Each user starts with 100 points as their initial balance.

In the menu page, the user can choose to play the game or view the highscore list. In the play page, the user can bet any amount of points between 1 and their balance. Each of the user and dealer are dealt two cards, but only one of the dealer’s cards is visible. The user can then choose to hit (get another card) or stand (stop getting cards). The dealer will hit until their card score is at least 17. The winner is determined by comparing the card scores of the user and the dealer. The user wins if their card score is closer to 21 than the dealer’s, or if the dealer’s card score is over 21. The user loses if their card score is over 21, or if the dealer’s card score is closer to 21 than theirs. The user draws if their card score is equal to the dealer’s. The user’s balance is updated accordingly after each round. In the highscore page, the user can see the scores of all users sorted in descending order using merge or quick sort algorithms.

The project is written in Java and uses object-oriented programming principles. The project demonstrates my skills in data structures, algorithms, encryption, and file handling.
